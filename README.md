# HTML / CSS Learning Project 
## Project Motivation
- I would love to create web apps.
- I have started applying these skills (HTML/CSS) with two models, it is a good start but I want to continue building front-ends to keep improving and learning.
## Project Goals
- The 3rd should be a good looking "form page" where a user can register or decide to login instead. 
## Project Requirements 

Functional requirements :
- Good looking, more professionnal than previous models.
- Would be good to understand the different ways of sending form data to a backend even if it is not implemented.

Technical requirements :
- Use grid instead of flexbox this time.
- Responsive Design
- Using Git during the whole project, with clear commit on what I did, committing to a GitHub repository.

## Planning
Start of the projet : 11/04/2024

End : 20/04/2024
