# HTML / CSS Learning Project 
## Project Motivation
- I would love to create web apps.
- I have seen more theory than I have put into practice in HTML / CSS, so I want and need to apply these skills to improve my learning.  
## Project Goals
What is not mentionned in this document is not in the scope of the project.
- Learn through direct application without following a tutorial but by taking a model (website page(s)) and recreating it without stealing the content, images, brand name by using original text and copyright free images. 
- The first model I have chosen is a clothes online shop. The images will be generated from an AI image generator and taken from unsplash : [Image 1](https://unsplash.com/fr/photos/un-groupe-de-trois-personnes-debout-lune-a-cote-de-lautre-SVG0HMVciAw), [Image 2](https://unsplash.com/fr/photos/un-couple-de-femmes-assises-au-sommet-dun-mur-de-ciment-DwrrY4FO5RE), [Image 3](https://unsplash.com/fr/photos/un-ordinateur-portable-et-une-plante-en-pot-IqBY9blj8Ks), [Image 4 Option A](https://unsplash.com/fr/photos/interieur-dun-magasin-de-vetements-P3pI6xzovu0), [Image 4 Option B](https://unsplash.com/fr/photos/vetements-accroches-sur-un-portant-a-vetements-fERtc6SsLVs).
- The second model inspiration comes from a LLM chat bot.
- The third is not a model but it should be a good looking "form page" (where user could enter data), designed on the go.
## Project Requirements 

Functional requirements :
- Should represent well the model, or be good looking (or not too bad).

Technical requirements :
- Use flexbox, floats and grid.
- At least one design should be responsive.
- Using Git with no predetermined workflow, during the whole project, with clear commit on what I did, committing to a GitHub repository.

## Project Conclusion 31/03/24 :
Model 1 : It was my first time recreating a website, I'm happy with the result. I learned a lot, I asked myself a lot of questions when making it. I realized the importance of having conventions for naming classes, organizing css, thinking about responsiveness at first, and the importance of having a designer that take care of the colors, fonts, providing images etc else it add work that is difficult to a developper. I do not think it is good but not too bad for a first one.
Model 2 : I learned from Model 1 and thought about responsiveness early during the development. I'm more than happy with the final results for this second time and I think that I will be able to continue with this project if I want to (to learn interactivity with JS for instance...). There are some limitation with the responsiveness (when the height is too small (around 600px) the side navigation bottom buttons disappear, and when the width < 270px it also behave strangely) but I still consider it a success for my first responsive page (it works differently for big screens (>960px) and smaller ones and as intended).

I used flexbox and foat. I used Git for the whole project and committed to this GitHub repository.
I did not meet the requirements of using grid, but I think that it was too ambitious and that doing a responsive with flexbox was challenging enough when we do it for the first time. 

I consider this project as a success, and I will plan for another project using grid. My lesson of this project (in addition to the learning made by the practice) will be to try to plan more realistically the next time.
