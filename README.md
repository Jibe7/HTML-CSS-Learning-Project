# HTML / CSS Learning Project 
## Project Motivation
- I would love to create web apps.
- I have seen more theory than I have put into practice in HTML / CSS, so I want and need to apply these skills to improve my learning.  
## Project Goals
What is not mentionned in this document is not in the scope of the project.
- Learn through direct application without following a tutorial but by taking a model (website page(s)) and recreating it without stealing the content, images, brand name by using original text and copyright free images. 
- The first model I have chosen is a clothes online shop. The images will be generated from an AI image generator and taken from unsplash : [Image 1](https://unsplash.com/fr/photos/un-groupe-de-trois-personnes-debout-lune-a-cote-de-lautre-SVG0HMVciAw), [Image 2](https://unsplash.com/fr/photos/un-couple-de-femmes-assises-au-sommet-dun-mur-de-ciment-DwrrY4FO5RE), [Image 3](https://unsplash.com/fr/photos/un-ordinateur-portable-et-une-plante-en-pot-IqBY9blj8Ks), [Image 4 Option A](https://unsplash.com/fr/photos/interieur-dun-magasin-de-vetements-P3pI6xzovu0), [Image 4 Option B](https://unsplash.com/fr/photos/vetements-accroches-sur-un-portant-a-vetements-fERtc6SsLVs).
- The second model inspiration comes from a LLM chat bot.
- The third is not a model but it should be a good looking "form page" (where user could enter data), designed on the go.
## Project Requirements 

Functional requirements :
- Should represent well the model, or be good looking (or not too bad).

Technical requirements :
- Use flexbox, floats and grid.
- At least one design should be responsive.
- Using Git with no predetermined workflow, during the whole project, with clear commit on what I did, committing to a GitHub repository.
